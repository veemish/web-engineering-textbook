vi
=============

This Guide will give you a very quick introduction to
the editor **vi**.

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

* recognize `vi` if you stumble into it
* get out of `vi` 
* understand the different modes 
* do basic editing in `vi`

Emergency Vi Help
------------

If you ever need to leave vi, try these commands:

First, always press `escape`

* then type in `:q!` and hit `enter` to quit without saving
* then type in `:wq!` and hit `enter` to save any changes made and then quit


`vi` is a very, very old editor that is still used today.
History
------------

`vi` is a very, very old editor that is still used today.
To understand how it works, and why it works this way, we
have to go back in time:

### ed

In 1969, when the operating system UNIX was first developed,
Teleprinters (also called teletypewriters, or short TTY) were
used as input and output devices for computers: a keyboard
for input, and a printer for output.

![Example of a Teleprinter](images/teletype-33.jpg)

For UNIX a **line editor** called **ed** was developed, that
could be used on TTYs. **ed** distinguishes command mode from text mode,
and always starts out in command mode.  

In the following example session the user first types in the command **a** 
(for 'append') to enter text mode, and then enters two lines of text
and a period on an empty line to leave text mode.

The editor gives no feedback at this point.  The user enters 
the command **p** to print out the current line.
Notice that only the current line is printed, not the whole file!

Next the user enters **i** (for 'insert'), modified by the number two
to indicate that the text should be inserted twice (before the current line).
The user enters a line of equal-signs and again a period on an empty line
to end the text-input.

The user finally uses the command **l** to output the text with extra information: 
a $ sign for the line endings is printed.  The comma before the l command
selets the range of lines to be printed (here: all the lines). To print
just lines 2 to 4 one would write **2,4l**.

Then the user types in a substitution command **s** to replace
the word "two" by the word "four". And finally the **w** (write) command
to save the text to a file and **q** (quit) to exit the editor.

### ex

The next step was the editor **ex** which brought a slight change
in interface: the input prompt is marked with a colon.

### vi

With monitors came the next version of the editor: the visual editor *vi*.

It now displays the content of the file (one screen at a time),
and offers a cursor - it almost looks and works like a modern text editor.
But *ed* and *ex* are still there, in the *normal mode* and *commandline* of vi.

Vi Modes
--------

![vi modes](images/vi-modes.svg)

Using *vi* you have to be aware which mode the editor is in. There
are only subtle visual clues to help you.

![vi modes](images/vi-recognize-modes.png)

As you can see in the images above, insert mode is distinguished
from normal mode by the showing `-- INSERT --` in the last line.
Command-line mode puts the cursor in the last line, and shows the colon
(that you typed in to get into command-line mode).
