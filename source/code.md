Static Code Analysis
------------------

Any automatic analysis done on the source code of a program
is called static analysis.  The simplest form is a check
of coding conventions. This is called "linting". 


## Style Guide

A Style Guide or Coding Convention tells places
restrictions on the way you write your code: it tells
you how deep indentation should be, whether to put
spaces inside brackts, and so on.

You can invest a lot of emotional energy in this, and fight
with your co-workers over the details of formatting.  Or
you can just decide on a style guide to follow, and be done
with the discussions.
